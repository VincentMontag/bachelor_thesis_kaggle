Secure system design principles include: Security by design: The entire system and its individual components are designed on the basis of and with a focus on security. Deliberate attacks and unauthorised actions are explicitly taken into account while any repercussions arising from a security event are minimised by the system’s inherent design. Minimal need-to-know principle: Each component and each user is only assigned the rights they need to execute a desired action. Applications and network services, for example, are not run under administrator privileges, but only with the bare minimum of required system access rights. Defence-in-depth principle: Security risks are not tackled via single protection measures, but limited through the implementation of staggered, multi-level and complementary security measures. Redundancy principle: The entire system is designed to ensure that the failure of individual components does not impair security-related functions. The system’s design lowers the likelihood and impact of issues caused by unrestricted requests for system resources such as e. g. main memory (RAM) or network bandwidth (so-called resource consumption or DoS attacks).",
